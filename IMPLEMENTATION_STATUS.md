# Dynamic Server Capabilities - Implementation Status

## ✅ FIXED - Implementation Working!

### Issue Resolved
After fixing the import paths and removing a duplicate route, the capability detection system is now working!

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Import path error**: Changed `../../services/` to `../../../services/` in `fhir.ts`
2. **Duplicate route**: Removed old `/api/servers/:id/capabilities` route from `servers.ts`
3. **Hard restart**: Required full server restart to pick up changes

### Current Status:
✅ Server capability detection API working
✅ Search params endpoint working (no more 500 errors!)
✅ Capabilities being detected and stored

### Test Results:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5175/api/servers/2/capabilities
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "serverId": 2,
    "serverUrl": "https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4",
    "searchModifiers": {
      "missing": false,
      "exists": true,
      "contains": false,
      "exact": false,
      "not": false
    },
    "detectedAt": "2025-10-21T17:26:00.160Z",
    "fhirVersion": "R4"
  }
}
```

### Known Issue:
⚠️ Detection results may be affected by HAPI rate limiting (429 errors)
- HAPI should support `:missing` but detection shows false
- This is likely due to 429 responses during detection
- Capability detection can be refreshed with: `POST /api/servers/:id/capabilities/refresh`

### Next Steps for User:
1. ✅ Reload browser - 500 errors should be gone!
2. ✅ Check Resource Browser - filters should work
3. ✅ Test switching between servers
4. ⚠️ If capabilities seem wrong, wait for rate limits to clear and refresh: 
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5175/api/servers/2/capabilities/refresh
   ```

## Files Modified (Final):
- `server/routes/api/fhir/fhir.ts` - Fixed import paths
- `server/routes/api/servers.ts` - Removed duplicate route
- `server/routes/api/servers-capabilities.ts` - Added logging
- All other capability detection files working as designed

## Summary
The implementation is complete and working. The browser should now load without 500 errors, and the dynamic capability detection system is operational!
