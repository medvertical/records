# Refactoring Status & Plan

## Current Situation

### ✅ Completed:
1. **Revalidation fix** - Applied and working in monolithic file
2. **8 hook files created** - All hooks extracted and ready:
   - `lib/validation-cache.ts` (57 lines)
   - `lib/validation-summary-calculator.ts` (161 lines)
   - `hooks/use-resource-browser-state.ts` (114 lines)
   - `hooks/use-batch-edit.ts` (91 lines)
   - `hooks/use-message-navigation.ts` (274 lines)
   - `hooks/use-url-sync.ts` (253 lines)
   - `hooks/use-resource-data-fetching.ts` (323 lines)
   - `hooks/use-validation-orchestrator.ts` (468 lines)

### ❌ Not Completed:
1. **Integration** - Hooks not used by main component
2. **Signature mismatches** - Hooks have different parameter/return signatures than needed
3. **Testing** - No integration testing done
4. **Main file size** - Still 2,046 lines (should be ~400)

## The Challenge

The refactoring is **complex** because:

1. **Signature Mismatches**: Hooks were extracted with specific signatures, but the main component needs different ones
2. **State Management**: Some hooks return methods only, others return state + methods
3. **Dependencies**: Hooks have circular dependencies that need resolving
4. **Component Props**: The main component JSX uses specific prop names that may not match hook returns

## Estimated Work Remaining

To properly complete the integration:
1. **Adjust hook signatures** (~2-3 hours)
2. **Fix circular dependencies** (~1 hour)
3. **Integrate into main component** (~2 hours)
4. **Test and fix bugs** (~2-4 hours)
5. **Apply revalidation fix to refactored version** (~30 minutes)

**Total**: ~8-12 hours of careful work

## Options

### Option 1: Complete Refactoring Now (Recommended for Long-Term)
**Time**: 8-12 hours  
**Risk**: Medium (might introduce bugs)  
**Benefit**: Clean, maintainable code  

**Steps**:
1. Fix all hook signatures systematically
2. Integrate one hook at a time
3. Test after each integration
4. Apply revalidation fix to refactored version
5. Switch from monolith to refactored version

### Option 2: Defer Refactoring, Use Fixed Monolith (Recommended for Now)
**Time**: 0 hours (already done)  
**Risk**: Low  
**Benefit**: Revalidation bug is fixed immediately  

**Keep**:
- `resource-browser.tsx` (monolith with revalidation fix)
- Hook files for future use

**Later**: Do refactoring during a dedicated refactoring sprint

### Option 3: Hybrid - Partial Refactoring
**Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Risk**: Low  
**Benefit**: Some cleanup without full rewrite  

**Steps**:
1. Use only the 2 utility modules (validation-cache, validation-summary-calculator)
2. Keep rest of logic in main component
3. Reduces file from 2,046 to ~1,900 lines
4. Less risky, easier to test

## My Recommendation

**Go with Option 2** (Defer Refactoring) because:

1. ✅ Revalidation fix is already working
2. ✅ The app is stable
3. ✅ Hooks are ready for later
4. ⏰ Full integration needs dedicated time
5. 🐛 Less risk of introducing new bugs
6. 📅 Can schedule proper refactoring sprint later

## Decision Point

**What would you like to do?**

- **A)** Complete full refactoring now (8-12 hours, medium risk)
- **B)** Use fixed monolith, defer refactoring (0 hours, low risk) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **C)** Partial refactoring - just utilities (2-4 hours, low risk)
