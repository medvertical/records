# Task List: Validation System Fixes and Real-time Validation

**Based on:** Analysis of current validation system implementation  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Goal:** Fix validation display issues and implement real-time validation with proper 6-aspect validation

## Validation Approach: Complete Validation + UI Filtering

**Key Principle:** The validation engine **always performs all 6 aspects** of validation, but the **UI filters and displays results** based on which aspects are enabled/disabled in the settings.

### Benefits of This Approach:
- ✅ **Complete validation data** is always available
- ✅ **UI filtering** is fast and responsive (no re-validation needed)
- ✅ **Settings changes** provide instant UI updates
- ✅ **Historical data** is preserved when settings change
- ✅ **No cache invalidation** needed when settings change
- ✅ **Better user experience** with immediate feedback

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Validation Engine:** Always performs all 6 aspects (structural, profile, terminology, reference, businessRule, metadata)
2. **Storage:** Stores complete validation results with all aspect data
3. **UI Filtering:** Filters display based on enabled/disabled aspects in settings
4. **Real-time Updates:** Settings changes instantly update UI without re-validation

### Notes

- The current system has validation infrastructure but resources show as "Valid" without actual validation
- Validation aspects are configurable but not properly reflected in UI
- Need to implement per-page validation and real-time settings updates
- Validation results should be cached per resource until revalidation is triggered
