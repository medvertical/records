# Task List: SSE Migration Cleanup and MVP Stabilization

## Relevant Files

- `server/services/websocket-server.ts` - WebSocket server service that needs to be removed
- `server.ts` - Main server file that may still have WebSocket references
- `client/src/hooks/use-validation-sse.ts` - SSE hook implementation
- `client/src/hooks/use-validation-controls.ts` - Validation controls hook
- `client/src/components/dashboard/validation-engine-card.tsx` - Validation engine component
- `client/src/components/validation/server-validation.tsx` - Server validation component
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Dashboard page
- `server/services/fhir-client.ts` - FHIR client service
- `server/services/validation-engine.ts` - Validation engine service
- `server/services/dashboard-service.ts` - Dashboard service
- `server/storage.ts` - Database storage service
- `shared/types/validation.ts` - Validation type definitions
- `shared/types/dashboard.ts` - Dashboard type definitions
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

### Notes

- The migration from WebSocket to SSE is complete but there are still WebSocket connections happening
- Server connection issues and validation engine state problems need investigation
- Data accuracy issues in dashboard numbers need to be resolved
- Code needs reorganization and refactoring for better maintainability
- All changes should maintain compatibility with the Records PRD requirements
