### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `validation-pipeline.ts` and `validation-pipeline.test.ts`)
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- Maintain SSE for progress updates; do not reintroduce WebSockets
- Preserve current API response shapes where necessary using a temporary adapter layer to avoid breaking the UI; introduce v2 endpoints only if needed

### Parity Notes (default engine vs. legacy/enhanced)

- Profile handling
  - Legacy: auto-detects profiles (resource.meta.profile + heuristics), validates via Simplifier/FHIR server.
  - Default: profile validation via `profileResolutionServers` from settings. Action: add optional pre-processing for auto-detect; consider optional Simplifier integration behind settings.
- Terminology validation
  - Legacy/Enhanced: TerminologyClient with multiple servers/priorities.
  - Default: driven by `terminologyServers` with priority; verify priority ordering and expansion caching.
- Business rules / custom rules
  - Legacy: `ValidationRule[]` custom rules applied per resource.
  - Default: BusinessRule aspect. Action: provide mapper to translate `ValidationRule` into business-rule checks or run a post-processor in adapter.
- Server-side $validate fallback
  - Legacy: may call FHIR server validation.
  - Default: engine-first. Action: optional fallback via adapter (feature-flagged) if parity required.
- Caching & performance
  - Enhanced: profile cache, timeout per aspect, max concurrency.
  - Default: supports `cacheSettings`, `timeoutSettings`, `maxConcurrentValidations`. Action: ensure settings are honored and logged.
- Issue model & filtering
  - Unified filters per active settings.
  - Action: centralize filtering in Pipeline/adapter; standardize issue codes/severities/aspect tagging.
- Batch control & progress
  - Robust supports pause/resume/state.
  - Pipeline: batch orchestration, SSE progress; pause/resume TBD. Action: either implement pause/resume or de-scope with clear API behavior.
- Output shape compatibility
  - Action: adapter maps default engine result â†’ legacy response shape for routes still expecting it; keep UI stable during migration.
