### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `settings.tsx` and `settings.test.tsx` in the same directory)
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- The current implementation has critical issues: duplicate API endpoints, broken state management, and incomplete service integration
- Settings persistence is inconsistent between different storage mechanisms causing data loss
- Server connection modal has complex retry logic that blocks UI interactions
