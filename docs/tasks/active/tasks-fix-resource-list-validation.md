# Task List: Fix Resource List Validation Integration

## Problem Statement

After implementing real FHIR validation, the resource list still shows 100% validation scores instead of realistic scores from the new validation engine. The validation settings dropdown fails to update and doesn't apply to resource list validation results. Resource list pages load slowly and show incorrect summaries.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Validation Service Disconnection**: Resource list components are not integrated with the new consolidated validation service
2. **Settings API Issues**: Validation settings dropdown has API communication problems
3. **Score Calculation Problems**: Resource list uses old scoring logic instead of real validation results
4. **Performance Issues**: No caching, inefficient loading, and missing batch processing
5. **Summary Inaccuracy**: Summary calculations don't reflect actual validation results

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Resource list shows realistic validation scores (not 100%)
- ✅ Validation settings dropdown works without errors
- ✅ Settings changes immediately affect resource list validation scores
- ✅ Resource list loads in 2-3 seconds with 50-100 resources per page
- ✅ Automatic validation triggers when loading resource lists
- ✅ Validation results are cached and reused appropriately
- ✅ Summary statistics are accurate and reflect real validation results
- ✅ Real-time updates show validation progress and completion
- ✅ Comprehensive filtering by validation status, severity, aspects, and resource types
- ✅ Quick filter presets for common workflows (errors, critical issues, unvalidated)
- ✅ Advanced filtering with issue count ranges and resource type include/exclude modes
- ✅ Filter persistence across browser sessions and export functionality

### Notes

- All validation operations should use the new consolidated validation service
- Implement proper caching with 5-minute TTL for validation results
- Use batch processing with 50-200 resources per batch for optimal performance
- Ensure validation settings changes trigger immediate re-validation of displayed resources
- Add comprehensive error handling and loading states for better UX
