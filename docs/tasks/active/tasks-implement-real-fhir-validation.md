# Task List: FHIR Validation MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Problem Statement

The current validation system shows 100% validation scores for all resources because the validators are stub implementations that don't perform actual FHIR validation. All validators return empty issue arrays, making every resource appear perfectly valid.

### Evidence of the Problem

From the logs and code analysis:
- **Structural Validator**: Only checks for basic fields (resourceType, id, meta) - not comprehensive FHIR structural validation
- **Profile Validator**: Only checks if profile URL is declared in meta.profile - no actual profile conformance validation  
- **Terminology Validator**: Returns empty results - no actual terminology validation
- **Reference Validator**: Likely similar stub implementation
- **Business Rule Validator**: Likely similar stub implementation
- **Metadata Validator**: Likely similar stub implementation

### Terminal Evidence

```
[ValidationEngine] Validation completed for Observation/2149887: { isValid: true, issueCount: 0, validationTime: 1 }
```

All aspects show:
- `issues: []` (empty arrays)
- `validationScore: 100` (perfect scores)  
- `passed: true` (no failures)
- `duration: 0` (too fast for real validation)

## MVP Solution (Get It Working Fast!)

Implement **basic working FHIR validation** that actually finds real issues:

### MVP Core (Essential Features!)
- **Multi-Version FHIR Support**: R4, R5, R6 validation using server CapabilityStatement
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate validator services for scalability and maintainability
- **Server-Version-Aware Validation**: Use CapabilityStatement to determine FHIR version
- **Real Issue Detection**: Make validators actually find problems
- **Fast Implementation**: Get working validation in 2-3 weeks, not months

### MVP Validation Components (Multi-Version)
- **Structural Validator**: Server-version-aware FHIR structure validation (R4/R5/R6)
- **Profile Validator**: Server-version-aware profile conformance checking
- **Terminology Validator**: Server-version-aware code validation against terminology servers
- **Reference Validator**: Server-version-aware reference existence checking
- **Business Rule Validator**: Server-version-aware domain rules (Patient age, etc.)
- **Metadata Validator**: Server-version-aware FHIR metadata validation

## MVP Dependencies (Simplified + Incremental)

### Phase 1-2: Basic Node.js Libraries (Start Simple)
- **fhir-validator**: Node.js FHIR validation library
- **fhir-schema**: Local FHIR schemas for R4 validation initially
- **moment**: Date validation and parsing
- **lodash**: Utility functions for data manipulation
- **axios**: HTTP client for CapabilityStatement retrieval

### Phase 3-4: Multi-Version Support (Add Complexity)
- **fhir-schema**: Extend to R5, R6 schemas
- **CapabilityStatement Parser**: For server version detection
- **FHIR Version Registry**: For managing R4, R5, R6 schemas

- **Express.js**: API framework for microservices
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **PM2**: Process management for microservices

### Fallback Strategy (If Complexity Fails)
- **Monolithic approach**: Keep validators in single service
- **Single version**: Focus on R4 only if multi-version proves too complex
- **Simple architecture**: Avoid microservices if not needed

### Essential Features (Incremental)
- ✅ Start with R4 validation that actually works
- ✅ Add R5/R6 support incrementally
- ✅ Add microservices only after core validation works
- ✅ Real issue detection and reporting
- ✅ Basic error handling and logging

## MVP Timeline (Simplified + Incremental)

### Total Time: 10-15 days (realistic with incremental approach)

**Week 1: Foundation & Basic Validation**
- **Day 1**: Fix critical blocking bug (validation settings service error)
- **Days 2-3**: Install basic libraries, implement CapabilityStatement retrieval
- **Days 4-5**: Implement basic R4 validators (structural, profile, terminology)

**Week 2: Multi-Version & Microservices**
- **Days 6-7**: Extend validators to R5/R6 support

- [ ] Real validation issues are found and reported across R4, R5, R6
- [ ] CapabilityStatement retrieval works for version detection
- [ ] Version-specific validation rules are applied correctly
- [ ] Microservices communicate properly and handle errors gracefully

#### Phase 5-6 Success (Full System)

## MVP Implementation Strategy (Incremental + Risk-Aware)

### Smart Incremental Approach!
1. **Fix blocking bug first** - resolve validation settings service error immediately
2. **Start simple** - get R4 validation working before adding complexity
3. **Add complexity incrementally** - R5/R6 support, then microservices
4. **Test early and often** - validate each phase before moving to next
5. **Have fallback plans** - be ready to simplify if complexity fails

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Phase 0 Critical**: Fix blocking bug or project fails
- **Phase 1-2 Safe**: Basic R4 validation with proven libraries
- **Phase 3-4 Medium Risk**: Multi-version support (can fall back to R4 only)
- **Phase 4-6 Higher Risk**: Microservices (can fall back to monolithic)

### What We're NOT Doing (For Now)
- ❌ Cloud deployment - run locally with Docker
- ❌ Complex monitoring - basic logging is fine
- ❌ AI/ML optimization - simple validation rules
- ❌ Enterprise features - just get it working
- ❌ Kubernetes orchestration - use Docker Compose

### What We ARE Doing (Incremental MVP)
- ✅ Start with R4 validation that actually works
- ✅ Add R5/R6 support incrementally
- ✅ Add microservices only after core validation works
- ✅ Real issue detection (not 100% scores)
- ✅ Fast implementation (2-3 weeks, not months)
- ✅ Working end-to-end system with fallback options

## MVP Notes (Incremental + Risk-Aware)

### Current Status
- **❌ BLOCKED**: Validation settings service error needs to be fixed first (CRITICAL)
- **✅ READY**: FHIR identity storage architecture is working
- **✅ READY**: Validation results storage and retrieval is working

### Incremental MVP Philosophy
- **Fix blocking issues first, then build incrementally**
- **Start simple with R4, add complexity gradually**
- **Test each phase before moving to the next**
- **Have fallback plans ready if complexity fails**
- **Celebrate small wins and iterate quickly**

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK**: Phase 0 (blocking bug) - project fails if not resolved
