# Tasks: Validation Engine Fixes

**Based on:** Validation Engine Audit Report + Analysis of Current Code  
**Priority:** Critical - System Unstable  
**Estimated Time:** 12 days  
**Approach:** Fix what's broken, keep what works, focus on MVP first

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **What's Actually Working**
1. **Validation Engine Core** - `ValidationEngine` class exists and has all 6 aspects
2. **Aspect Validators** - Individual validators (Structural, Profile, etc.) exist
3. **Type System** - `ALL_VALIDATION_ASPECTS` constant and types are defined
4. **Consolidated Service** - `ConsolidatedValidationService` exists with proper structure
5. **Settings Service** - Validation settings service exists
6. **Storage Layer** - Database operations work
7. **Pipeline** - Validation pipeline exists

### 🚨 **What's Broken**
1. **Missing API Endpoints** - UI hooks calling non-existent endpoints
2. **Settings Integration** - Engine checks `isAspectEnabled()` instead of always performing all aspects
3. **Data Flow Issues** - Validation data not reaching UI properly
4. **Resource Enhancement** - `enhanceResourcesWithValidationData` has issues
5. **Silent Failures** - Poor error handling and logging
6. **Settings Real-time Updates** - Aspect switching doesn't update validation results/scores in real-time
7. **Resource Type Filtering** - No scope definition for which resource types to validate
8. **Cache Override** - No revalidation capability to override cached results

### 🎯 **Fix Strategy**
- **Keep Working Code** - Don't rewrite what's already working
- **Fix Core Principle** - Make engine always perform all 6 aspects
- **Add Missing API Endpoints** - Implement what UI needs
- **Fix Data Flow** - Ensure data reaches UI
- **Add Error Handling** - No more silent failures
- **Implement Settings Real-time Updates** - Aspect switching updates results/scores immediately
- **Add Resource Type Filtering** - Define validation scope by resource types
- **Add Cache Override** - Revalidation capability to override cached results
- **Focus on MVP First** - Get basic system working before adding advanced features

## Global Development Rules (global.mdc)

**CRITICAL: All execution must follow the global.mdc rules. Review before starting any phase.**

### 📜 Core Philosophy
- **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
- **Root Cause First:** Always try to fix problems at the cause, not just the symptom. Temporary workarounds require explicit approval.
- **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than rewriting from scratch unless explicitly required.
- **Focus:** Concentrate on the specific task. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
- **Quality:** Strive for a clean, well-tested, and secure codebase.

### 🧱 Project Structure & Organization
- **File Length:** Break files when they approach 400 lines; never exceed 500 lines.
- **Function Size:** Keep functions under 30–40 lines.
- **Class Size:** If a class surpasses ~200 lines, split it into smaller helper classes or modules.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each file/class/function handles one concern only.
- **Modular Design:** Build interchangeable, testable, isolated modules.

### 🧪 Development Workflow
1. **Plan:** Break tasks into sub-steps. Confirm assumptions with docs or teammates when unsure.
2. **Small Commits:** Make granular, well-described commits. Keep the working tree clean.
3. **Edit, Don't Copy:** Modify existing files; avoid ad-hoc duplicates (e.g., `component-v2.tsx`).
4. **Verify Integrations:** After refactoring, ensure all callers/integration points still work. Run relevant tests.

### ✅ Testing & Validation
1. **TDD Mindset:** For new features, outline tests → write failing tests → implement → refactor.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Add unit/integration/e2e tests covering critical paths and edge cases.
3. **Passing Tests:** All tests must pass before considering a task complete.
4. **No Mock Data Outside Tests:** Use mock data only in testing contexts. Dev/prod paths should rely on real or realistic data sources.

### 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting
1. **Root Cause Fixes:** Focus on eliminating underlying issues, not masking errors.
2. **Log Inspection:** Check browser/server logs after changes or when debugging.
3. **Targeted Logging:** Add temporary logs for stubborn bugs—remember to clean up afterward.
4. **Research:** When stuck, research best practices before guessing.

### 🔒 Security Practices
- Keep sensitive logic/validation/data manipulation on the server side.
- Always sanitize and validate user input server-side.
- Never commit secrets/credentials. Use environment variables or secure secret management.

### 🌳 Version Control & Environment
- Follow good Git hygiene: atomic commits, no unrelated files, honor `.gitignore`.
- Never commit `.env`. Use `.env.example` for templates.
- Stop running servers before starting new ones, and restart servers after relevant config/backend changes.
