# Settings Save Fix - Complete Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

### Problem
Settings tabs were not saving properly:
- Dashboard Settings: PUT request → backend only accepted POST
- System Settings: PUT request → backend only accepted POST  
- All settings stored in memory (lost on server restart)
- No console logging for debugging

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed HTTP Method Mismatch ✅
- Added PUT route handlers to `dashboard-settings.ts`
- Added PUT route handlers to `system-settings.ts`
- Kept POST for backwards compatibility

#### 2. Added Database Persistence ✅
- Created migration `023_add_app_settings_tables.sql`
- Implemented `DashboardSettingsRepository` with SQLite
- Implemented `SystemSettingsRepository` with SQLite
- Settings now persist across server restarts

#### 3. Enhanced Logging ✅
- Added detailed console logging in frontend tabs
- Added structured logging in backend routes
- Added repository-level logging
- All logs prefixed with component name for easy filtering

#### 4. Improved Error Handling ✅
- Better error messages with details
- Response data logged for debugging
- Toast notifications show specific error messages

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Frontend Component
    ↓ PUT /api/{settings-type}
Route Handler (dashboard-settings.ts)
    ↓
Repository (DashboardSettingsRepository)
    ↓
SQLite Database (profiles/dev.db)
    ↓
Response JSON
    ↓
Frontend Toast + Console Log
```

### Database Schema
- `dashboard_settings` table (single row, auto-created)
- `system_settings` table (single row, auto-created)
- Triggers for automatic `updated_at` timestamps
- Indexes on updated_at for future queries

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/dashboard-settings         - Fetch current settings
POST /api/dashboard-settings         - Update settings (legacy)
PUT  /api/dashboard-settings         - Update settings (primary)

GET  /api/system-settings            - Fetch current settings
POST /api/system-settings            - Update settings (legacy)
PUT  /api/system-settings            - Update settings (primary)
GET  /api/system-settings/export     - Export as JSON
```
