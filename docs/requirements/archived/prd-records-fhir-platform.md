## 4. Functional Requirements (Observed from Codebase)

### 4.1 FHIR Server Management
1. **Server Connection Management**
   - Connect to FHIR servers via URL with authentication support
   - Test server connectivity and retrieve metadata
   - Support for multiple concurrent server connections
   - Automatic FHIR version detection (R4/R5)

2. **Server Configuration**
   - Store server credentials and authentication settings
   - Manage active server selection
   - Server health monitoring and status display
   - Active server switch reactivity: all views (resource browser, detail, dashboard, counts, validation queries) immediately bind to the newly selected server; client and server caches are namespaced per server (e.g., cache keys include `serverId`) to prevent cross‑server bleed

### 4.2 Resource Discovery & Management
3. **Comprehensive Resource Discovery**
   - Automatic discovery of all available resource types from server CapabilityStatement
   - Support for 146+ FHIR resource types (R4: 143 types, R5: 154 types)
   - Dynamic resource type detection based on server version
   - Resource counting with intelligent caching (5-minute cache duration)

4. **Resource Browsing & Search**
   - Browse resources by type with pagination
   - Search resources by ID, content, or metadata
   - Resource detail viewing with JSON formatting
   - Resource tree viewer for complex nested structures
   - Resource editing (single) with immediate revalidation on save
   - Batch selection and batch editing of resources with queued revalidation after apply

### 4.3 Validation Engine
5. **Multi-Aspect Validation System**
   - **Structural Validation:** JSON schema and FHIR structure compliance
   - **Profile Validation:** Conformance to specific FHIR profiles
   - **Terminology Validation:** Code system and value set validation
   - **Reference Validation:** Resource reference integrity checking
   - **Business Rule Validation:** Cross-field logic and business constraints
   - **Metadata Validation:** Version, timestamp, and metadata compliance
   - Per-aspect processing and storage for: Structural, Profile, Terminology, Reference, Business Rules, Metadata
   - Automatic validation on browse: when a resource page is loaded, page resources are validated and results persisted per aspect
   - Batch validation runs in the background (dashboard control) and stores results in the same per-aspect format as single validations
   - Settings changes invalidate all existing validation results; the system revalidates resources; UI shows clear “Validating…” state and disabled-aspect treatment
   - Views react immediately to settings changes: the UI recalculates visibility and aggregations (e.g., disabled aspects greyed/excluded) while background revalidation updates persisted results

6. **Simplified Validation Configuration**
   - Unified validation settings with 6-aspect configuration
   - Simplified settings model with minimal complexity
   - Normalized validation results across all aspects
   - Consolidated validation service API
   - Streamlined settings management without legacy audit trails

### 4.4 Real-time Validation Processing
7. **Batch Validation Operations**
   - Bulk validation across server datasets
   - Background processing with progress tracking and clear status indicators
   - Safe concurrency and back-pressure to protect the connected FHIR server
   - Pause/Resume controls available on the Validation Engine card in the Dashboard
   - MVP constraint: only one active batch validation at a time (single-run). Architectural note: future versions may support multiple batch validations in parallel (out of MVP scope)

8. **Progress Updates (MVP - Polling-based)**
   - Polling-based updates (defaults: 30s) for validation progress, settings, and dashboard statistics
   - Batch validation result updates propagated via polling and cache refresh
   - Progress persistence across browser sessions
   - Post-edit revalidation: edits (single or batch) enqueue affected resources for revalidation; UI reflects pending → updated states

### 4.5 Dashboard & Analytics
9. **Comprehensive Dashboard**
   - Resource statistics and breakdown by type
   - Validation progress tracking with completion percentages
   - Error and warning summary displays
   - Performance metrics and timing information

10. **Validation Reporting**
    - Detailed validation results with error categorization
    - Validation trend analysis over time
    - Resource quality scoring and metrics
    - Export capabilities for validation reports
 
### 4.8 Issue Filtering & Grouping (New)
11. **Same-Message Grouping**
    - Group resources by identical validation message signature: aspect + severity + code + normalized path + ruleId (optional) + normalized text
    - Endpoints to list groups, fetch group members (paginated), and navigate to resource detail with the message highlighted
12. **List/Detail Parity**
    - The list’s coverage/score and counts must match the detail view for the same resource and aspect set
    - Disabled aspects are greyed/clearly indicated and excluded from score aggregation

### 4.9 API Contracts (MVP)
1. `GET /api/validation/issues/groups`
   - Query: `aspect?`, `severity?`, `code?`, `path?`, `resourceType?`, `page=1`, `size=25`, `sort=count:desc|severity:desc`
   - Returns: `[{ signature, aspect, severity, code, canonicalPath, totalResources, sampleMessage }]`
2. `GET /api/validation/issues/groups/:signature/resources`
   - Query: `resourceType?`, `page=1`, `size=25`, `sort=validatedAt:desc`
   - Returns: `[{ resourceType, fhirId, validatedAt, perAspect: { aspect, isValid, errorCount, warningCount } }]`
3. `GET /api/validation/resources/:resourceType/:id/messages`
   - Returns: `{ resourceType, fhirId, aspects: [{ aspect, messages: [{ severity, code, canonicalPath, text, signature, timestamp }] }] }`
4. `GET /api/validation/progress`
   - Returns current batch state: `{ state: queued|running|paused|completed|failed, total, processed, failed, startedAt, updatedAt, etaSeconds? }`
5. `PUT /api/fhir/resources/:resourceType/:id`
   - Headers: `If-Match: <versionId|ETag>` (optional but recommended)
   - Body: full FHIR resource JSON; server validates and persists; enqueues revalidation of this resource
   - Returns: `{ success: true, versionId, queuedRevalidation: true }`
6. `POST /api/fhir/resources/batch-edit`
   - Body: `{ resourceType, filter: { query... }, operations: [{ op: replace|remove|add, path, value? }] }`
   - Server applies operations to matching resources (atomic per resource), audits before/after hash, enqueues revalidation; Returns: `{ matched, modified, failed }`

### 4.10 Scoring & Coverage Rules (MVP)
- Per-aspect score default: `isValid ? 100 : max(0, 100 - 100 * (errorCount > 0 ? 1 : 0) - 50 * warningBuckets)` (simple binary for errors; warnings reduce but do not zero). Exact formula can be replaced later; list/detail must share the same function.
- Aggregated resource score = average of enabled aspects’ scores.
- Disabled aspects are excluded from aggregation and shown greyed/disabled.
- Not-yet-validated aspects render as "Validating…" and are excluded from score until result is present; coverage indicator reflects only validated enabled aspects.

### 4.11 Edit & Batch-Edit Verhalten (Konflikte & Audit)
- Konflikterkennung: Client sendet `If-Match: <versionId|ETag>`; bei Mismatch → `409 Conflict`.
- Validierung: Eingehende Ressourcen werden syntaktisch geprüft (FHIR JSON), Größe begrenzt (konfigurierbar), Feld‑Whitelists optional.
- Audit (minimal): pro Resource `before_hash`, `after_hash`, `editedAt`, `editedBy` (System/Benutzer), Ergebnis (success/failed, reason).
- Revalidierung: Single‑Edits sofort in Queue; Batch‑Edits enqueue pro Resource (atomic pro Resource, partieller Erfolg erlaubt). Priorität über Batch‑Validierung.

### 4.12 Signatur‑Normalisierung (Same‑Message Grouping, MVP)
- Eingabeparameter der Signatur: `aspect | severity | code | canonicalPath | ruleId? | normalizedText`.
- Normalisierungsregeln:
  - `severity`: lowercase (`ERROR` → `error`).
  - `canonicalPath`:
    - FHIR‑Pfad normalisieren, Array‑Indizes entfernen (z. B. `entry[3].item[0].code` → `entry.item.code`).
    - Mehrfache Trennzeichen reduzieren, führende/trailing Punkte entfernen.
    - Lowercase, Whitespace entfernen.
    - Maximale Länge 256 Zeichen (ansonsten rechts abschneiden, separat im Datensatz `path_truncated=true`).
  - `normalizedText`:
    - Trim, Whitespace‑Kollaps (alle Sequenzen → ein Leerzeichen), Lowercase.
    - Steuerzeichen entfernen; maximale Länge 512 Zeichen (ansonsten rechts abschneiden, Flag `text_truncated=true`).
  - `code` und `ruleId` unverändert (außer Trim), falls vorhanden.
- Hash‑Bildung: `signature = SHA‑256(aspect + '|' + severity + '|' + (code||'') + '|' + canonicalPath + '|' + (ruleId||'') + '|' + normalizedText)` (hex‑String).
- Stabilitätsgarantie: Solange diese Regeln unverändert bleiben, ist die Signatur stabil. Regeländerungen werden versioniert (z. B. `signature_version`).

### 4.13 Queue‑Policy & Timeouts (MVP Defaults)
- Priorität: Edit‑/Batch‑Edit‑Revalidierungen > reguläre Batch‑Validierung.
- Concurrency: bis zu 8 gleichzeitige Validierungsjobs (konfigurierbar), Back‑pressure bei externen 429/Timeouts.
- Retry: bis zu 2 Retries pro fehlgeschlagenem Job, Exponential Backoff (Basis 1s, Max 30s), Abbruch bei Client‑Fehlern (4xx außer 429).
- Pause/Resume: über Dashboard steuerbar; MVP erlaubt nur einen aktiven Batch‑Run (Single‑Run); Resume setzt Queue an gleicher Stelle fort.
- Timeouts (Defaults, konfigurierbar):
  - Terminology: 60s
  - Profile: 45s
  - Reference: 30s
  - Externe HTTP‑Aufrufe: 15–60s je nach Dienst; Circuit‑Breaker bei anhaltenden Fehlern.
- Schutzlimits: maximale Batch‑Edit‑Größe (z. B. 5.000 Ressourcen) und Request‑Body‑Size limitiert; Rate‑Limit pro Serververbindung durch Concurrency geregelt.

---

## 7. MVP Approach & Polling Strategy

### 7.1 MVP Philosophy
The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and rapid deployment over advanced real-time features. This approach ensures:

- **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminates WebSocket/SSE infrastructure requirements
- **Better Reliability:** Polling is more predictable and easier to debug
- **Faster Development:** Simpler implementation reduces development time
- **Easier Deployment:** No need for WebSocket server configuration or connection management
- **Better Error Handling:** Polling failures are easier to recover from than connection drops

### 7.2 Polling Implementation Details
- **Default Intervals:** 30 seconds for settings, results, and dashboard statistics (configurable)
- **Configurable Intervals:** Polling frequency can be adjusted based on validation progress
- **Smart Polling (Optional):** Reduce polling frequency when validation is idle or completed
- **Progress Persistence:** Validation progress is stored in database and retrieved on each poll
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues to function even if polling temporarily fails
- **Resource Efficiency:** Polling only occurs when validation is active or recently completed

### 7.3 Future Enhancement Path
The polling-based approach provides a clear upgrade path to real-time features:
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Polling-based progress updates
2. **Phase 2:** Optional WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
3. **Phase 3:** Hybrid approach with polling fallback for reliability

---

## 8. Technical Considerations

### 8.1 Architecture
- **Full-Stack TypeScript Application** with shared type definitions
- **Frontend:** React 18 with Vite build system and Wouter routing
- **Backend:** Express.js server with TypeScript and consolidated validation architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state and React hooks for local state
- **Validation Engine:** Consolidated validation service with unified 6-aspect validation and simplified settings

### 8.1.1 Validation Data Model (MVP Extensions)
- Per-aspect validation results persisted with timestamps, counts, and scores
- Normalized validation messages (aspect, severity, code, canonical path, text) with a stable signature for grouping
- Indexes on (server, signature), (server, aspect, severity), and (server, resource identity) to support filtering and grouping

### 8.1.2 Cross-Server Resource Identity (Simple & Secure)
- Server registry (table) stores each connected FHIR server with a generated immutable `server_id` and a `server_fingerprint` derived from the normalized base URL (e.g., lowercase, trimmed, trailing slash removed). Recommended: `server_fingerprint = SHA-256(normalized_base_url)`.
- The canonical FHIR resource identity is strictly scoped by server: `(server_id, resource_type, fhir_id)`.
- A derived, stable identity string may be used in logs/keys: `fhir_identity = `${server_id}:${resource_type}:${fhir_id}``.
- For collision-resistant joins across components, an opaque UID can be computed: `resource_uid = SHA-256(server_fingerprint + '|' + resource_type + '|' + fhir_id)`. This avoids accidental cross-server conflation while remaining stable and non-reversible beyond the input tuple.
- All validation data (`validation_results`, `validation_messages`, groups) include `server_id` and the triple `(resource_type, fhir_id)`; all queries and caches are namespaced by `server_id`.
- Security/consistency rules:
  - Never treat equal `fhir_id` across different servers as the same resource.
  - When resolving references, ensure the reference’s base (if absolute) matches the active `server_id` (or is explicitly allowed by settings) before dereferencing.
  - Client cache keys and React Query keys must include `server_id` to prevent cross-server data bleed.

### 8.2 Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Caching:** 5-minute resource count caching for dashboard performance
- **Batch Processing:** Concurrent request handling with rate limiting (8 concurrent requests)
- **Background Processing:** Non-blocking validation operations with progress tracking
- **Memory Management:** Efficient resource handling for large datasets (800K+ resources)
 - **Signature Caching:** Cache group counts/signatures for fast “same-message” queries
 - **Indexes:** Ensure per-aspect and message-signature queries meet p95 latency targets (<500ms list/group)

### 8.3 External Integrations
- **FHIR Servers:** RESTful API integration with automatic version detection
- **Simplifier Platform:** Profile search and installation via Simplifier API
- **Terminology Servers:** Configurable terminology validation services
- **Polling-based Updates:** Periodic progress updates for validation status (MVP approach)

### 8.4 Development & Deployment
- **Environment Configuration:** Environment-based configuration with .env support
- **Database Migrations:** Drizzle Kit for database schema management
- **Build System:** Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript coverage across frontend and backend
