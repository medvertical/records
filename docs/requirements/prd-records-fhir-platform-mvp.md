# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Records FHIR Validation Platform – MVP v1.1

**Date:** October 2025  
**Version:** MVP v1.1 (Hybrid Validation Architecture)  
**Document Type:** Product Requirements Document for MVP Release  

---

## 1. Introduction / Overview

**Records** is a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) validation and management platform that enables healthcare organizations and IT teams to inspect, validate, and improve the quality of FHIR data across one or more servers.  
The MVP focuses on a **hybrid validation engine** capable of operating in both **online (remote-connected)** and **offline (self-contained)** modes.

Validation follows HL7’s recommended approach, covering all computable aspects (structure, cardinality, bindings, profiles, invariants) while offering additional local checks for metadata and business rules.  
The system integrates the **HAPI FHIR Validation Engine** as its core, connecting to public demo endpoints for remote validation and to a **local Ontoserver** for terminology resolution in offline mode.

### Key Concepts
- **Six-Aspect Validation:** Structural · Profile · Terminology · Reference · Metadata · Business Rules  
- **Hybrid Mode:** switch between *Online (tx.fhir.org / Simplifier / HAPI FHIR demo)* and *Offline (local Ontoserver + cached IGs)*  
- **Editable Resources:** users can correct issues directly (“in-place”) or via batch edit, triggering immediate re-validation  
- **Per-Aspect Results:** results are stored separately for each aspect to ensure deterministic re-validation and precise filtering  

### Target Audience
- **Primary Users:** FHIR server administrators · health IT specialists · compliance officers  
- **Secondary Users:** developers · QA teams · system integrators  
- **Use Cases:**  
  - validating and comparing resources across servers  
  - checking profile and terminology compliance  
  - tracking validation progress and data-quality trends  
  - correcting resources in-place and validating changes immediately  

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Comprehensive HL7-Compliant Validation**  
   Perform six-aspect validation using HAPI FHIR Validator with optional `$validate` server calls and local Ontoserver fallback.

2. **Hybrid Connectivity (Online ↔ Offline)**  
   Enable runtime selection between remote validation services (e.g. `tx.fhir.org`) and offline packages (local Ontoserver + cached IGs).

3. **Immediate Feedback**  
   Provide per-aspect validation results and visual status indicators in list and detail views, updated automatically after edits.

4. **In-Place & Batch Editing**  
   Allow single-resource correction and batch updates that trigger queued re-validation while preserving previous results for comparison.

5. **Unified Validation Storage**  
   Persist normalized results per aspect with stable message signatures for grouping, filtering, and statistical reuse.

6. **Simple Configuration**  
   Centralized YAML/JSON config or UI switches controlling which aspects and servers are active, plus offline/online toggle.

7. **Scalable Polling**  
   Polling-based progress updates for reliability (30 s default), ensuring stable operation without WebSockets.

8. **Usable Demo Mode**  
   Pre-configured to use public endpoints:  
   - Profiles → Simplifier Packages  
   - Terminology → `tx.fhir.org`  
   - Reference Validation → `https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4`  

---

## 3. User Stories (MVP Scope)

### Server Management
- **As an administrator**, I can connect multiple FHIR servers with authentication and switch between them to compare datasets.  
- **As a user**, I can test connectivity before running a validation to ensure endpoints respond correctly.  
- **As an administrator**, I can toggle *Online* or *Offline* Mode to control whether external connections are used.

### Resource Validation
- **As a compliance officer**, I can validate all resources on a server across all six aspects.  
- **As a developer**, I can validate a single resource and instantly see structured feedback.  
- **As a user**, I can re-validate resources after edits and view updated aspect results.  
- **As a validator**, I can filter messages by identical signature to triage systemic issues quickly.

### Editing & Remediation
- **As a user**, I can edit a resource inline and save it back to the server; the system immediately enqueues re-validation.  
- **As an administrator**, I can run a batch edit (e.g. replace a field across 100 resources) and monitor progress.  
- **As a user**, I can compare old vs new validation outcomes to verify improvement.

### Dashboard & Monitoring
- **As a manager**, I can view aggregated error/warning statistics by aspect and severity.  
- **As a user**, I can see validation progress and estimated completion time.  
- **As an administrator**, I can pause, resume, or restart a batch validation job.

## 4. Functional Requirements (MVP)

### 4.1 Server Management
1. Connect to one or more FHIR servers via base URL and optional authentication.  
2. Detect FHIR version (R4/R5) automatically.  
3. Store server settings and selected mode (Online / Offline).  
4. Refresh all resource lists when active server changes.  

### 4.2 Validation Engine
1. **Structural Validation:** schema and datatype checks via HAPI FHIR Validator.  
2. **Profile Validation:** enforce selected Implementation Guide packages (Simplifier URLs / local cache).  
3. **Terminology Validation:** check codes against `tx.fhir.org` (online) or local Ontoserver (offline).  
4. **Reference Validation:** ensure referenced resources exist (remote FHIR demo server or active server).  
5. **Metadata Validation:** verify `meta.lastUpdated`, `versionId`, and security tags per policy.  
6. **Business Rules:** execute configurable FHIRPath/JSONPath rules (cross-field logic).  
7. Validation results are persisted per aspect and exposed through a unified API.  
8. Each validation run produces a normalized OperationOutcome mapped to an internal `IssueCard` schema.

### 4.3 Editing & Revalidation
1. **In-Place Edit:** edit a resource JSON → save → enqueue revalidation; show pending state until complete.  
2. **Batch Edit:** apply field operations to multiple resources (atomic per resource); queue revalidation jobs.  
3. **Conflict Detection:** use `If-Match` ETag; on mismatch → HTTP 409 Conflict.  
4. **Audit Fields:** minimal metadata (`before_hash`, `after_hash`, `editedAt`, `editedBy`).  

### 4.4 Batch Validation
1. Start batch validations manually from the dashboard.  
2. Allow one active batch job at a time (MVP constraint).  
3. Show progress (queued / running / paused / completed).  
4. Apply back-pressure and retry logic for external requests.  

### 4.5 Configuration & Modes
1. Unified config file or UI panel controlling:  
   ```yaml
   mode: online | offline
   validation:
     aspects:
       structural: true
       profile: true
       terminology: true
       reference: true
       metadata: true
       businessRules: true
   servers:
     terminologyServer: https://tx.fhir.org/r4
     referenceServer: https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4
     profileSources:
       - https://packages.simplifier.net/hl7.fhir.r4.core@4.0.1
       - https://packages.simplifier.net/de.basisprofil.r4@1.3.2
     offline:
       terminologyServer: http://localhost:8081/fhir
       profileCachePath: /opt/fhir/igs/

	2.	Each aspect can be toggled on/off at runtime; disabled aspects appear greyed out in UI.
	3.	Switching to offline mode automatically redirects terminology and profile lookups to local Ontoserver and cached IG packages.

⸻

5. Non-Goals / Out of Scope (for MVP)
	1.	Multi-tenancy — single-tenant deployment only.
	2.	User authentication/authorization — no login or RBAC.
	3.	Realtime WebSockets/SSE — polling only.
	4.	Advanced analytics or ML features — post-MVP.
	5.	Full audit trail beyond minimal edit metadata.
	6.	Automated error remediation — manual edits only.
	7.	Complex compliance reporting — simplified exports only.

⸻

Next sections (6 → 10) will cover design considerations, polling strategy, architecture, success metrics, and open questions consistent with this new scope.

---

Perfect — here’s the continuation of the rewritten PRD (Sections 6–10) in the same style and level of detail, optimized for the MVP scope, HL7-compliant validation behavior, and the hybrid (online/offline) Records architecture.

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Validation Architecture Overview
The MVP uses a **modular, aspect-based validation engine** following HL7’s recommended validation layers:

| Aspect | Source / Method | Description |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Structural** | HAPI FHIR Validator | Validates JSON schema, datatypes, and cardinalities. |
| **Profile** | HAPI + Simplifier Packages / Cached IGs | Checks StructureDefinitions and profile bindings. |
| **Terminology** | HL7 Terminology Service (`tx.fhir.org`) or local Ontoserver | Validates CodeSystem / ValueSet bindings. |
| **Reference** | FHIR server REST lookups | Ensures referenced resources exist. |
| **Metadata** | Custom Rules Engine | Checks `meta.*` consistency and completeness. |
| **Business Rules** | Custom FHIRPath / JSONPath engine | Evaluates organization-specific logical rules. |

Each aspect is executed independently and results are persisted in normalized form.  
This modular design allows selective activation, caching, and clear separation of remote and local responsibilities.

---

### 6.2 Online vs Offline Mode
**Online Mode (Demo / Connected):**
- Terminology lookups via `tx.fhir.org`
- Profiles loaded from Simplifier or HL7 IG Registry
- Reference resolution through remote FHIR servers
- `$validate` optional for demo visualization

**Offline Mode (Self-Contained):**
- Terminology resolution via local Ontoserver (port 8081)
- Profiles read from cached `.tgz` packages (e.g. `/opt/fhir/igs/`)
- Reference resolution only within local dataset
- No outbound network connections

**UI Indicators:**
- Clear “Mode: Online / Offline” badge in the header  
- Disabled icons for aspects not available offline (e.g. remote references)

---

### 6.3 User Interface Design
- **Framework:** React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui components  
- **Layout:** Sidebar navigation with resource list, detail, and dashboard tabs  
- **Aspect Toggles:** Enable/disable aspects via top-bar switches (Structural, Profile, etc.)  
- **Validation Results:**
  - Tabbed per aspect
  - Issue grouping by identical signature (aspect + severity + code + canonicalPath + normalizedText)
  - Color-coded severity badges
  - “Skipped” indicator if an aspect is disabled or not applicable
- **Editing:**
  - Inline JSON editor with diff preview before save
  - Batch-edit modal with operation summary
  - Progress display per batch job

---

### 6.4 UX & Feedback Patterns
- **Polling-based updates** (30s default, adaptive down to 10s when active)
- **Progressive validation display:** list updates incrementally as results arrive
- **Visual coverage badges:** % of aspects validated for each resource
- **Consistent list/detail parity:** identical counts and severity distributions
- **Error cards:** short diagnostic + source (e.g. `tx.fhir.org`, `Ontoserver`, `Custom Rule`)
- **Retry / Resume controls:** for failed batch jobs or interrupted edits

---

### 6.5 Data Model
| Entity | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **validation_results** | Per-aspect validation summary (valid, errorCount, warningCount, timestamp) |
| **validation_messages** | Normalized issues (aspect, severity, code, canonicalPath, normalizedText, signature) |
| **validation_groups** | Aggregated same-message signatures |
| **validation_jobs** | Batch validation run metadata (state, progress, totals) |
| **fhir_servers** | Connected servers with configuration and fingerprints |
| **fhir_resources** | Cached metadata for validated resources |
| **edits / batches** | Edit operations and minimal audit metadata |

---

## 7. MVP Approach & Polling Strategy

### 7.1 MVP Philosophy
The MVP emphasizes **reliability, transparency, and HL7-conformant validation** over scale or automation.  
It aims to demonstrate the core architecture, hybrid connectivity, and UI workflow end-to-end.

**Principles:**
- “Conservative senders, liberal receivers” (Postel’s Law): validate comprehensively, fail gracefully.  
- Remote dependencies (tx.fhir.org, Simplifier) are optional — offline fallback always available.  
- All long-running operations (validation, batch edits) update via polling.

---

### 7.2 Polling Details
- **Default interval:** 30 s (configurable)  
- **Dynamic intervals:** reduced when idle, increased when active  
- **Endpoints polled:**  
  - `/api/validation/progress` → batch job status  
  - `/api/validation/issues/groups` → updated groups  
  - `/api/validation/resources/:id` → per-aspect refresh  
- **Resilience:**  
  - Skips missed polls; resumes gracefully  
  - Exponential backoff after network errors  
  - Automatically marks outdated results as “Pending revalidation”

---

### 7.3 Future Evolution
| Phase | Enhancement |
|--------|--------------|
| **Phase 1 (MVP)** | Polling-only progress and updates |
| **Phase 2** | Optional WebSocket/SSE for live updates |
| **Phase 3** | Hybrid real-time mode with polling fallback |

---

## 8. Technical Architecture

### 8.1 Stack Overview
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + Vite + TanStack Query | UI, validation status, edits |
| **Backend** | Express + TypeScript | REST API, job orchestration |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM | Validation & job persistence |
| **Validator** | HAPI FHIR CLI / API | Structural + Profile validation |
| **Terminology** | Ontoserver / tx.fhir.org | Code/ValueSet resolution |
| **Caching** | In-memory + Postgres | Resource & terminology caching |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose | Combined app + Ontoserver + Postgres |

Excellent — here’s the final section (11) rewritten to align with the new hybrid MVP scope and your realistic architecture path.
It maintains the tone and structure of the original PRD’s “Good / Bad / Ugly” section but is updated for the Records FHIR Validation Platform – MVP v1.1 you’re actually building now.

⸻


## 11. Quality Assessment: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### 11.1 The Good ✅

**Architecture & Design**
- **HL7-Compliant Core:** Built on HAPI FHIR Validation Engine, following HL7’s official guidance for structure, profile, and terminology validation.  
- **Hybrid Architecture:** Switchable Online / Offline modes using tx.fhir.org and Ontoserver.  
- **Aspect-Based Engine:** Modular six-aspect system allows precise control and consistent data modeling.  
- **Unified Results Model:** Per-aspect validation results stored with stable message signatures for grouping and parity.  
- **Modern Tech Stack:** React + TypeScript + Express + PostgreSQL ensures maintainability and type safety.  
- **Clear MVP Scope:** Focused on validation, feedback, and correction — not on enterprise-scale multi-tenancy.  

**User Experience**
- **Immediate Feedback:** Validation results update automatically after in-place or batch edits.  
- **List/Detail Parity:** 1:1 consistency between resource lists and detail views across aspects.  
- **Visual Clarity:** Clear aspect toggles, color-coded severities, and coverage indicators.  
- **Data Quality at a Glance:** Dashboard aggregates issues and completion rates per aspect.  
- **Demo-Friendly:** Works out-of-the-box with public endpoints and requires minimal configuration.

**Technical Implementation**
- **Polling-Based Stability:** Predictable, resilient progress tracking without WebSocket complexity.  
- **Terminology Flexibility:** Ontoserver support ensures full offline validation capability.  
- **Structured Config:** YAML-based configuration for modes, servers, and aspect switches.  
- **Editable Resources:** Immediate post-edit validation loop demonstrates real-world workflow.  
- **Containerized Deployment:** Runs as a small, composable stack (App + Ontoserver + DB).

---

### 11.2 The Bad ⚠️

**Scalability & Performance**
- **Single Queue Constraint:** Only one active batch validation job at a time (MVP limitation).  
- **Limited Parallelism:** 8-job concurrency adequate for MVP, not for enterprise scale.  
- **Latency Variability:** Dependent on external endpoints (tx.fhir.org, Simplifier).  
- **No Long-Term Indexing:** Validation history persists but without full audit rollups.

**Functional Gaps**
- **Simplified Error Model:** Warnings and info-level results normalized but not yet categorized by standard FHIR codes.  
- **Manual Mode Switch:** Requires user or admin toggle — no auto-detection of offline availability.  
- **Minimal Business Rules:** Only basic JSONPath/FHIRPath expressions supported in MVP.  
- **Limited Reference Scope:** Reference validation confined to current or demo FHIR servers.

**Data Handling**
- **No Complex Audit Trail:** Only minimal before/after hashes for edits.  
- **No Export Scheduling:** Reports exportable manually only (JSON/CSV).  
- **Limited Retention Logic:** Validation results persist indefinitely until manually cleared.  

---

### 11.3 The Ugly 🚨

**Missing Production Features**
- **No Authentication or Access Control:** All operations open by design (demo focus).  
- **No Multi-Tenancy:** One deployment = one environment.  
- **No Observability:** Missing metrics, tracing, or structured logs beyond console output.  
- **No Backup or Snapshot Mechanism:** Database persistence only, no automated backup layer.  

**Operational Risks**
- **External Dependency Volatility:** Public endpoints (tx.fhir.org, Simplifier, HAPI demo) can throttle or be unavailable.  
- **Error Transparency:** Remote validation errors can be unclear to non-technical users.  
- **No Circuit Breaker UI:** Connectivity errors not yet surfaced as warnings in the dashboard.  

---

### 11.4 Recommendations for Improvement

**Immediate (MVP+ / next 4–6 weeks)**
1. **Add Metrics & Logging:** Integrate lightweight health endpoints and structured logs.  
2. **Expand Rule Engine:** Add visual rule editor for JSONPath / FHIRPath expressions.  
3. **Enhance Mode UX:** Auto-detect offline/online state and notify users of switch.  
4. **Error Enrichment:** Map validator codes to friendly explanations (e.g., terminology lookup failed → “Unknown CodeSystem”).  

**Short-Term (Next Release Cycle)**
1. **Parallel Batch Jobs:** Introduce multi-job queue with concurrency controls.  
2. **Profile Package Manager:** Cache and update IG packages automatically (Simplifier + local path).  
3. **Audit Enhancements:** Add per-edit user tracking and change history view.  
4. **Reporting:** Add scheduled exports and summary reports (JSON → CSV → PDF).  

**Mid-Term (Production Readiness)**
1. **Add Authentication:** API key or OAuth2 layer for user access.  
2. **Add Monitoring Stack:** Prometheus + Grafana + structured app metrics.  
3. **Resilience Layer:** Local cache fallback for tx.fhir.org outages.  
4. **Compliance & Audit:** Align with ISO/IEC 27001 and BSI IT-Grundschutz requirements.

## Conclusion

The **Records FHIR Validation Platform (MVP v1.1)** establishes a strong and realistic foundation for hybrid FHIR validation.  
It balances HL7-compliant validation logic with operational simplicity, enabling users to validate, inspect, and correct FHIR resources across environments.  

By embedding the **HAPI FHIR Validator** and supporting both **remote demo endpoints** and **local Ontoserver integration**, Records demonstrates a practical, standards-aligned path toward enterprise-grade validation.  
The MVP offers tangible value: interactive validation, in-place correction, and hybrid mode flexibility — while leaving scalability, user management, and compliance automation for future iterations.

In summary:
- ✅ Technically sound and HL7-aligned  
- ✅ Usable end-to-end demo with real data and public servers  
- ⚠️ Not yet production-ready for KRITIS or multi-user setups  
- 🚀 Well positioned for iterative growth toward a full validation platform
