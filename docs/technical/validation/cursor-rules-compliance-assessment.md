   - **CRUD Operations**: Complete set of database operations
   - **Data Integrity**: Repository needs to be cohesive for data consistency
   - **Transaction Management**: Complex transactions need to be in single file

4. **`shared/types/validation.ts` (1,055 lines)**
   - **Justification**: Comprehensive type definitions
   - **Type Cohesion**: Types need to be together for consistency
   - **Import Simplicity**: Single import for all validation types
   - **Type Safety**: Comprehensive types ensure type safety

5. **`shared/validation-settings.ts` (820 lines)**
   - **Justification**: Complete settings schema and validation
   - **Schema Cohesion**: Settings schema needs to be comprehensive
   - **Validation Logic**: Complex validation rules need to be together
