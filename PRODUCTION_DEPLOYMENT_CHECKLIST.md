## 🔧 Production Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required for production
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
FHIR_SERVER_URL=your_production_fhir_server_url

# Optional optimizations
PORT=3000
CACHE_TTL=300000
MAX_CONCURRENT_VALIDATIONS=10
BATCH_SIZE=200
```

### **Database Setup**
- [x] PostgreSQL database configured
- [x] Database migrations applied
- [x] Proper indexing for performance
- [x] Connection pooling configured
- [x] Backup strategy in place

### **Server Configuration**
- [x] Express.js server optimized for production
- [x] Static file serving configured
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Error handling middleware in place
- [x] Logging configured for production

## 📦 Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### **Option 2: Docker Deployment**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for production
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist/ ./dist/
COPY server/ ./server/
COPY shared/ ./shared/
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### **Option 3: Traditional Server Deployment**
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Use PM2 for process management
pm2 start dist/index.js --name "records-fhir-platform"
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### **Health Checks**
- [ ] Verify `/api/health` endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Verify FHIR server connection works
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints respond correctly

### **Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Monitor memory and CPU usage
- [ ] Monitor error rates and logs

### **User Acceptance Testing**
- [ ] Test validation engine functionality
- [ ] Test real-time UI updates
- [ ] Test resource filtering
- [ ] Test cache override functionality
- [ ] Test analytics and dashboard

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### **Production Security**
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all communications
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Database credentials protected
- [ ] API rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] CORS properly configured

### **Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] Application monitoring setup
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Log aggregation configured
- [ ] Alert thresholds set

## 📊 Production Metrics

### **Expected Performance**
- **API Response Time**: <50ms (target: <500ms)
- **Dashboard Loading**: <1s (target: <2s)
- **Validation Throughput**: 1000+ resources/minute
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for 800K+ resources
- **CPU Usage**: <50% under normal load

### **Scalability**
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ simultaneous users
- **Resource Capacity**: 800K+ FHIR resources
- **Database Connections**: 20+ concurrent connections

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### **Rollback Procedures**
1. **Database Rollback**: Restore from latest backup
2. **Code Rollback**: Deploy previous stable version
3. **Configuration Rollback**: Restore previous environment variables
4. **Cache Clear**: Clear all application caches
