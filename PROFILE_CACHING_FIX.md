# Profile Caching Database Error Fix

## Problem

Profile caching was failing with SQL syntax error:
```
[ProfileResolver] Failed to cache profile in database: error: syntax error at or near ","
```

This caused major validation performance issues because:
- Profiles couldn't be cached in the database
- Each validation had to re-fetch profiles from external sources
- Profile resolution took ~767ms per profile
- Some validations timed out at 30 seconds

## Root Cause Analysis

The `cacheProfileInDatabase()` method in `ProfileResolver` had multiple issues:

### 1. **Undefined Values**
When caching base FHIR profiles (like `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient`), some fields were `undefined`, which Drizzle ORM's SQL template doesn't handle properly, causing syntax errors.

### 2. **Date Object Handling**
JavaScript `Date` objects were being passed directly to SQL:
```typescript
${profile.date ? new Date(profile.date) : new Date()}
```

This caused issues with PostgreSQL's TIMESTAMP column expecting ISO strings.

### 3. **Source Value Mismatch**
TypeScript type had `'local-cache'` as a source value:
```typescript
source: 'local-cache' | 'database' | 'simplifier' | 'fhir-registry'
```

But the database CHECK constraint didn't include it:
```sql
CHECK (source IN ('simplifier', 'fhir-registry', 'npm', 'local', 'filesystem', 'database'))
```

### 4. **Empty Objects vs Arrays**
Some JSONB fields were being stored as `{}` when they should be `[]`:
```typescript
${JSON.stringify(profile.contact || {})}  // Should be []
```

## Solution Implemented

### Changes to `profile-resolver.ts`

1. **Added Proper Null Handling**:
```typescript
const dateValue = profile.date ? new Date(profile.date).toISOString() : new Date().toISOString();
const versionValue = result.version || 'latest';
const baseDefinitionValue = baseDefinition || null;
const purposeValue = profile.purpose || null;
const copyrightValue = profile.copyright || null;
```

2. **Fixed Source Value Mapping**:
```typescript
let sourceValue = result.source;
if (sourceValue === 'local-cache') {
  sourceValue = 'local';
}
```

3. **Changed Empty Objects to Arrays**:
```typescript
${JSON.stringify(profile.contact || [])}
${JSON.stringify(profile.useContext || [])}
${JSON.stringify(profile.jurisdiction || [])}
${JSON.stringify(profile.context || [])}
```

4. **Used ISO String for Dates**:
```typescript
${dateValue}  // Already converted to ISO string
```

## Expected Impact

### Performance Improvements

1. **Profile Caching Now Works**:
   - Profiles are successfully cached in database
   - Subsequent validations use cached profiles
   - No need to re-fetch from external sources

2. **Faster Validation**:
   - Profile resolution: ~767ms → < 10ms (from cache)
   - Reduced timeout failures
   - Better batch validation performance

3. **Reduced External API Calls**:
   - Fewer calls to Simplifier.net
   - Fewer calls to FHIR Registry
   - Less network overhead

### Example Improvement

**Before** (without caching):
- 20 resources × 767ms profile resolution = ~15 seconds just for profile fetching
- Plus validation timeouts = 30-60 seconds total

**After** (with caching):
- First validation: 767ms (cache miss)
- All subsequent: < 10ms (cache hit)
- 20 resources × ~10ms = 200ms for profile resolution
- **75x faster** for profile resolution

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check Server Logs** for successful caching:
```bash
tail -f server-output6.log | grep "Successfully cached profile"
```

Should see:
```
[ProfileResolver] Successfully cached profile: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient
```

2. **Check Database**:
```sql
SELECT canonical_url, version, source, cached_at 
FROM profiles_cache 
ORDER BY cached_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

3. **Monitor Validation Performance**:
   - Batch validation should complete much faster
   - Fewer timeout errors in logs
   - Profile resolution times < 10ms (except first fetch)

## Related Issues

This fix addresses:
- Profile validation timeouts (30 seconds)
- Slow batch validation performance
- Repeated external API calls
- Database syntax errors in logs

## Next Steps

After this fix, you may want to:

1. **Test batch validation** - should be significantly faster
2. **Monitor cache hit rate** - check `access_count` in `profiles_cache` table
3. **Consider reducing timeout** - from 30s to 10s now that caching works
4. **Pre-cache common profiles** - for frequently used profiles

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test validation with server logs
cd /Users/sheydin/Sites/records
tail -f server-output6.log | grep -E "ProfileResolver|ValidationEngine|timeout"

# Check cached profiles
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*), source FROM profiles_cache GROUP BY source;"
```
