## 7. MVP Approach & Polling Strategy

### 7.1 MVP Philosophy
The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and rapid deployment over advanced real-time features. This approach ensures:

- **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminates WebSocket/SSE infrastructure requirements
- **Better Reliability:** Polling is more predictable and easier to debug
- **Faster Development:** Simpler implementation reduces development time
- **Easier Deployment:** No need for WebSocket server configuration or connection management
- **Better Error Handling:** Polling failures are easier to recover from than connection drops

### 7.2 Polling Implementation Details
- **Configurable Intervals:** Polling frequency can be adjusted based on validation progress (e.g., every 2-5 seconds during active validation)
- **Smart Polling:** Reduce polling frequency when validation is idle or completed
- **Progress Persistence:** Validation progress is stored in database and retrieved on each poll
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues to function even if polling temporarily fails
- **Resource Efficiency:** Polling only occurs when validation is active or recently completed

### 7.3 Future Enhancement Path
The polling-based approach provides a clear upgrade path to real-time features:
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Polling-based progress updates
2. **Phase 2:** Optional WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
3. **Phase 3:** Hybrid approach with polling fallback for reliability
