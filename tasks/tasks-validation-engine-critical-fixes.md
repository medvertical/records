## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria:
- ✅ Validation pipeline processes resources without `split()` errors
- ✅ Progress counters update correctly in real-time
- ✅ Validation results are generated and stored properly
- ✅ Bulk validation workflow functions end-to-end

### Phase 2 Success Criteria:
- ✅ Single validation engine handles all 6 aspects (Structural, Profile, Terminology, Reference, Business Rules, Metadata)
- ✅ All legacy validation engines removed (validation-engine.ts and enhanced-validation-engine.ts deleted)
- ✅ Validation performance optimized for 800K+ resources
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for single engine
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect single engine architecture

## Notes

- **Priority Order:** Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2
