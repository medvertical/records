## Relevant Files

- `client/src/pages/settings.tsx` - Main settings page component with broken state management and duplicate API calls
- `client/src/components/settings/rock-solid-settings.tsx` - Complex settings UI component with conflicting state management
- `client/src/components/settings/server-connection-modal.tsx` - Server connection modal with overly complex retry logic
- `client/src/hooks/use-validation-settings.ts` - Settings hook with API integration problems and duplicate functionality
- `client/src/hooks/use-fhir-data.ts` - FHIR data hooks with duplicate settings functions that conflict with main settings hook
- `client/src/hooks/use-server-data.ts` - Server data management hook with refresh logic
- `server/routes.ts` - Server routes with duplicate and conflicting validation settings endpoints (lines 866-991 vs 2141-2290)
- `server/repositories/validation-settings-repository.ts` - Settings repository with proper database operations
- `server/services/validation-settings-service.ts` - Settings service (referenced but needs proper implementation)
- `shared/validation-settings.ts` - Settings schema and types with comprehensive validation structure
- `shared/validation-settings-validator.ts` - Settings validation logic (referenced but needs implementation)

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `settings.tsx` and `settings.test.tsx` in the same directory)
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- The current implementation has critical issues: duplicate API endpoints, broken state management, and incomplete service integration
- Settings persistence is inconsistent between different storage mechanisms causing data loss
- Server connection modal has complex retry logic that blocks UI interactions
