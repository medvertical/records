### Notes

- Keep files ≤ 500 lines; split > 400 lines (SRP).
- Single, shared aggregation/score function for list and detail.
- Per-server namespacing in caches/keys (always include server_id).
- Polling defaults 30s (settings/results/stats); edit revalidation has higher priority than batch.
- Signature normalization (path/text) and SHA‑256 hashing per PRD; version `signature_version`.
- Respect `.cursor/rules/global.mdc` across all tasks (architecture boundaries, SRP, naming, file-size limits, testing workflow).

### 3. **Execution Order Refinement**
- **Reorganized into 6 logical phases** with clear rationale

- **Added phase descriptions** for clarity (Risk Mitigation, Backend Foundation, etc.)

### 4. **Dependency Clarity**
- Security validation now informs edit APIs (12.0 → 3.0)
- Scoring utility available before UI consumption (9.0 → 6.0/7.0)
- Shared polling hook created before dashboard/settings (8.5 → 18.11/19.8)
- Performance validation happens before UI delivery

### 5. **Risk Mitigation**
- Feature flag infrastructure defined explicitly (16.1a-d)
- CI/CD implementation detailed (16.2a-d)
- Rollback testing mandatory (1.9)
- Load testing validates performance budgets (10.5)
- Graceful degradation for missing FHIR aspects (4.7)

### 6. **Operational Completeness**
- Dev data seeding for faster development (1.11)
- Stale data cleanup prevents bloat (4.8)
- Settings migration handles legacy data (1.12)
