  - [x] 3.6 Update main dashboard component to use separate cards with clear data source labels
  - [x] 3.7 Add data source indicators (e.g., "FHIR Server: 807K resources" vs "Validated: 1,234 resources")

- [x] 4.0 Fix Unvalidated Resource Counting
  - [x] 4.1 Update `getResourceStatsWithSettings()` to stop counting unvalidated resources as errors
