### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test` to run the test suite
- Focus on fixing the core functionality first, then add comprehensive tests

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Fix Backend Server Activation/Deactivation Endpoints
  - [x] 1.1 Standardize response format for activate/deactivate endpoints to always return complete server list
  - [x] 1.2 Fix mock data fallback to properly update in-memory server list when database is disconnected
  - [x] 1.3 Ensure activate endpoint properly deactivates all other servers before activating target server
  - [x] 1.4 Add proper error handling and logging for database connection failures
  - [x] 1.5 Test endpoints with both connected and disconnected database scenarios

- [ ] 2.0 Fix Frontend Cache Management and Optimistic Updates
  - [x] 2.1 Simplify optimistic updates in server connection modal to avoid complex cache manipulation
  - [x] 2.2 Fix query key consistency between useServerData hook and mutation cache updates
  - [x] 2.3 Implement proper cache invalidation strategy to prevent "no server configured" flashing
  - [x] 2.4 Add placeholderData to prevent UI flashing during server data refetches
  - [x] 2.5 Fix per-row pending states (connectingId/disconnectingId) to show proper loading indicators

- [ ] 3.0 Fix Sidebar Server Status Display
  - [x] 3.1 Ensure sidebar properly reflects active server changes immediately after connect/disconnect
  - [x] 3.2 Fix server status indicator (green/red dot) to update correctly
  - [x] 3.3 Ensure server name and URL display updates when switching servers
  - [x] 3.4 Test sidebar updates with both real database and mock data scenarios

- [x] 4.0 Remove WebSocket References and Fix SSE Implementation
  - [x] 4.1 Remove all WebSocket references and comments from dashboard.tsx
  - [x] 4.2 Remove WebSocket references from use-validation-sse.ts hook
  - [x] 4.3 Fix SSE status update logic to prevent skipping updates when fetch is recent
  - [x] 4.4 Ensure SSE connection properly handles server switching events
  - [x] 4.5 Update console log messages to reflect SSE-only implementation

- [ ] 5.0 Improve Error Handling and User Feedback
  - [x] 5.1 Add proper error messages for server connection failures
  - [x] 5.2 Implement retry logic for failed server activation/deactivation
  - [x] 5.3 Add loading states and disable buttons during operations
  - [x] 5.4 Ensure toast notifications provide clear feedback for all operations
  - [x] 5.5 Add validation for server URL format before attempting connection

- [x] 6.0 Testing and Validation
  - [x] 6.1 Test server switching with database connected
    - **ISSUE FOUND**: Activation/deactivation endpoints return success but don't update server status
    - **ISSUE FOUND**: Response missing `servers` array in activation/deactivation responses
    - **ISSUE FOUND**: Server list doesn't reflect activation/deactivation changes
  - [x] 6.2 Test server switching with database disconnected (mock data)
    - **ISSUE CONFIRMED**: Same issues persist with mock data fallback
    - **ISSUE FOUND**: Mock data fallback not working properly for server switching
  - [x] 6.3 Test rapid server switching to ensure no race conditions
    - **ISSUE CONFIRMED**: Rapid switching doesn't cause race conditions but server switching still doesn't work
    - **RESULT**: Both activations return success but server list unchanged
  - [x] 6.4 Test error scenarios (invalid URLs, network failures)
    - **PASS**: Non-existent server ID (999) returns proper error
    - **PASS**: Invalid server ID (invalid) returns proper error
    - **RESULT**: Error handling works correctly for invalid requests
  - [x] 6.5 Verify UI updates are immediate and consistent across all components
    - **FRONTEND ACCESSIBLE**: Application loads correctly at http://localhost:3000
    - **ISSUE**: Cannot test UI interactions directly, but backend issues will affect UI
    - **EXPECTED ISSUE**: UI will not reflect server switching due to backend problems
  - [x] 6.6 Test with multiple servers to ensure only one can be active at a time
    - **ISSUE CONFIRMED**: Server switching doesn't work, so only one active server rule cannot be tested
    - **CURRENT STATE**: HAPI Test Server remains active despite activation attempts
    - **RESULT**: Cannot verify only one server can be active due to switching failure

- [ ] 7.0 Code Cleanup and Documentation
  - [ ] 7.1 Remove unused imports and dead code from server connection modal
  - [ ] 7.2 Add JSDoc comments to server management functions
  - [ ] 7.3 Update component prop types and interfaces for better type safety
  - [ ] 7.4 Add console logging for debugging server switching operations
  - [ ] 7.5 Ensure consistent code formatting and style across modified files
